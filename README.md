To start I made a variable for the url as a constant so that it cannot be changed at all even with other variables being added updated or removed from it.  I then created a constant variable for the data and then used the D3 libarary to upload the data from the json file and log it.

To set up the variables for the bar charts created a function from the url and json data to select the ID and then add the option and value from that ID.  I set up the function to display the first set of data in the list by default within the same begining function.  For the second function I created a function to read of the ID selected in the dropdown menu so that way when the new ID takes places the function also pulls the correct data that relates to the ID now selected.
